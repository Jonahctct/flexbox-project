        <div class="quote-text">Ever since we moved into our newest home, we felt that something was missing.
            After finally reaching out to the guys at AquaMain, they helped design, install, setup, and now maintain
            our large, beautiful reef aquarium. Now everyday that I get home, I'm able to sit down and relax, watching 
            for what feels like hours, my lovely fish exist inside their very own ecosystem. The best part is, I don't 
            have to worry about a thing!
